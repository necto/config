# SPC SPC - regex-search all path in the project
# in all search buffers, separate terms by space, each ntnerm must match a substring in any pos
# sXX - "snipe" - move cursor to the first occurence of characters XX in the string.
#                ";" - next match, on any subsequent line within the screen, "," - previous one
# SXX - "snipe" backwards
# v i - evil "expand" for smart object selecting
# v ... o - swap cursor between ends of a region (point <-> mark)
# doom starts emacs server automatically. So if my emacs is running,
# I can open `emacsclient -c <file>` instead of lunching a second emacs
# g s s - avy-goto-char - press chars and jump directly
