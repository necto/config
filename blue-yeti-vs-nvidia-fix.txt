Fix the Blue Yeti mic being shut after re-login and after a wake-up due to Nvidia shenanigans.
The only thing from the recipe found here: https://github.com/DeStezz/Blue-Yeti-Mic-Fix/
is to raise priority for snd-usb-audio and (maybe unnecessary snd-hda-intel). See the diff:

$ diff bkp.alsa-base.conf /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf 
33c33
< options snd-usb-audio index=-2
---
> options snd-usb-audio index=1
43c43,45
< options snd-usb-audio index=-2
---
> # No, don't https://github.com/DeStezz/Blue-Yeti-Mic-Fix
> options snd-usb-audio index=1
> options snd-hda-intel index=1
